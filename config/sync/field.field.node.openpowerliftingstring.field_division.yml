description: "Optional. Free-form UTF-8 text describing the division of competition, like `Open` or `Juniors 20-23` or `Professional`.\r\n\r\nSome federations are *configured* in our database, which means that we have agreed on a limited set of division options for that federation, and we have rewritten their results to only use that set, and tests enforce that. Even still, divisions are not standardized *between* configured federations: it really is free-form text, just to provide context.\r\n\r\nInformation about age should not be extracted from the `Division`, but from the `AgeClass` column.\r\n"

description: "Mandatory. The equipment category under which the lifts were performed.\r\n\r\nNote that this *does not mean that the lifter was actually wearing that equipment!* For example, GPC-affiliated federations do not have a category that disallows knee wraps. Therefore, all lifters, even if they only wore knee sleeves, nevertheless competed in the `Wraps` equipment category, because they were allowed to wear wraps.\r\n\r\nValues are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Raw: Bare knees or knee sleeves.\r\n- Wraps: Knee wraps were allowed.\r\n- Single-ply: Equipped, single-ply suits.\r\n- Multi-ply: Equipped, multi-ply suits (includes Double-ply).\r\n- Straps: Allowed straps on the deadlift (used mostly for exhibitions, not real meets).\r\n\r\nThe `Equipment` column is defined by [modules/opltypes/src/equipment.rs](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/blob/master/modules/opltypes/src/equipment.rs)."
